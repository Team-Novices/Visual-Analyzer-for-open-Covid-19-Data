# Visual-Analyzer-for-open-Covid-19-Data
This project was created as part of the 2021 NASA Space Apps Challenge.

It collects open data from a widely used dataset hosted in Johns Hopkins University and creates a platform for anyone who would do a comparative analysis on these data for Country and Time Specific Covid Data Reporting, Matching and Visualization. The data is reported in graphical form as well for better visualization and comparison.
